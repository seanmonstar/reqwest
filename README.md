An ergonomic, batteries-included HTTP Client for Rust.

- Plain bodies, JSON, urlencoded, multipart
- Customizable redirect policy
- HTTP Proxies
- HTTPS via system-native TLS (or optionally, rustls)
- Cookie Store
- WASM
- [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)


## Example

This asynchronous example uses [Tokio](https://tokio.rs) and enables some
optional features, so your `Cargo.toml` could look like this:

```toml
[dependencies]
reqwest = { version = "0.11", features = ["json"] }
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

And then the code:

```rust,no_run
use std::collections::HashMap;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let resp = reqwest::get("https://httpbin.org/ip")
        .await?
        .json::<HashMap<String, String>>()
        .await?;
    println!("{:#?}", resp);
    Ok(())
}
```

## Blocking Client

There is an optional "blocking" client API that can be enabled:

```toml
[dependencies]
reqwest = { version = "0.11", features = ["blocking", "json"] }
```

```rust,no_run
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let resp = reqwest::blocking::get("https://httpbin.org/ip")?
        .json::<HashMap<String, String>>()?;
    println!("{:#?}", resp);
    Ok(())
}
```

**NOTE**: Please have in mind that running Blocking Client client inside the Tokio Runtime will result into a panic.

## Requirements

On Linux:

- OpenSSL 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.1.0, or 1.1.1 with headers (see https://github.com/sfackler/rust-openssl)

On Windows and macOS:

- Nothing.

Reqwest uses [rust-native-tls](https://github.com/sfackler/rust-native-tls),
which will use the operating system TLS framework if available, meaning Windows
and macOS. On Linux, it will use OpenSSL 1.1.
