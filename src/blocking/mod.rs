//! A blocking Client API.
//!
//! The blocking `Client` will block the current thread to execute, instead
//! of returning futures that need to be executed on a runtime.
//!
//! Conversely, the functionality in `reqwest::blocking` must *not* be executed
//! within an async runtime, or it will panic when attempting to block. If
//! calling directly from an async function, consider using an async
//! [`reqwest::Client`][crate::Client] instead. If the immediate context is only
//! synchronous, but a transitive caller is async, consider changing that caller
//! to use [`tokio::task::spawn_blocking`] around the calls that need to block.
//!
//! # Optional
//!
//! This requires the optional `blocking` feature to be enabled.
//!
//! # Making a GET request
//!
//! For a single request, you can use the [`get`] shortcut method.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use reqwest::{Error, Response};
//!
//! # fn run() -> Result<(), Error> {
//! let body = reqwest::blocking::get("https://www.rust-lang.org")?
//!     .text()?;
//!
//! println!("body = {:?}", body);
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Additionally, the blocking [`Response`] struct implements Rust's
//! `Read` trait, so many useful standard library and third party crates will
//! have convenience methods that take a `Response` anywhere `T: Read` is
//! acceptable.
//!
//! **NOTE**: If you plan to perform multiple requests, it is best to create a
//! [`Client`] and reuse it, taking advantage of keep-alive connection pooling.
//!
//! # Making POST requests (or setting request bodies)
//!
//! There are several ways you can set the body of a request. The basic one is
//! by using the `body()` method of a [`RequestBuilder`]. This lets you set the
//! exact raw bytes of what the body should be. It accepts various types,
//! including `String`, `Vec<u8>`, and `File`. If you wish to pass a custom
//! Reader, you can use the `reqwest::blocking::Body::new()` constructor.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use reqwest::Error;
//! #
//! # fn run() -> Result<(), Error> {
//! let client = reqwest::blocking::Client::new();
//! let res = client.post("http://httpbin.org/post")
//!     .body("the exact body that is sent")
//!     .send()?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## And More
//!
//! Most features available to the asynchronous `Client` are also available,
//! on the blocking `Client`, see those docs for more.

/// **NOTE**: This function creates a new internal `Client` on each call,

/// ```rust
/// # fn run() -> Result<(), reqwest::Error> {

/// ```
///
/// # Errors
///
/// This function fails if:
///
/// - the native TLS backend cannot be initialized,
/// - the supplied `Url` cannot be parsed,
/// - there was an error while sending request,
/// - a redirect loop was detected,
/// - the redirect limit was exhausted, or
/// - the total download time exceeds 30 seconds.
